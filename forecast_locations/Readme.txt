Right so my understanding of the way it works is the app pulls in the nearest gazz location to the user. then if thats not a forecast location it then pulls in the nearest forecast location to the gazz location

so if your current location is a forecast location when you click it it will still use the phones current location with the gazz in brackets

but if its not a forecast location it will just replace the name with the forecast location name
