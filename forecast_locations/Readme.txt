Right so my understanding of the way it works is the app pulls in the nearest gazz location to the user. then if thats not a forecast location it then pulls in the nearest forecast location to the gazz location

so if your current location is a forecast location when you click it it will still use the phones current location with the gazz in brackets

but if its not a forecast location it will just replace the name with the forecast location name



Hi WD,

Please could you respond to the customer with:

Our App uses a Google Geolocation service which returns the name of your current GPS location. In this case, your location appears to be matching the address of a nearby local business, whose address is registered at "Reeds Farmhouse". I can appreciate that this must be irritating for you if you live close by.
There are two options which might help to resolve this.
Firstly, you could "search and save" your location in the App for the nearest place that our App already knows about, so that it does not need to ask Google's GPS location system. I think in this case, you would select "Holt Pound (Hampshire)" which is close enough to still give you accurate local weather.
Alternatively, you could change the Met Office App to use coarse location finding - go to your Settings -> Location -> Met Office App -> Disable the "Use precise location" button. This might match your location against either the road name, or the nearest town.
